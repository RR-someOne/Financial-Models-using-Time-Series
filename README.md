## Financial Models using Time Series and Financial Forecasting

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the implementation and analysis of various financial models using time series data. The project provides a collection of scripts and notebooks that demonstrate how to apply common time series techniques to financial data, including forecasting, volatility modeling, and backtesting strategies. The goal is to provide a practical resource for understanding and building predictive financial models.

## Features
Diverse Model Implementations: Includes popular time series models such as ARIMA, GARCH, and Exponential Smoothing.

Data Handling: Scripts for loading and preprocessing financial data from common sources.

Visualization: Tools for visualizing time series data, model forecasts, and performance metrics.

Backtesting & Evaluation: Frameworks for backtesting trading strategies and evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and Sharpe Ratio.

Modular Code: The codebase is organized into modular components for easy extension and customization.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package manager)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/RR-someOne/Financial-Models-using-Time-Series.git](https://github.com/RR-someOne/Financial-Models-using-Time-Series.git)
cd Financial-Models-using-Time-Series

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: The requirements.txt file should contain all necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels, etc.

Usage
Each model or analysis will typically have its own script or Jupyter notebook. For example, to run the ARIMA model on a sample dataset, you might use:

python scripts/arima_model.py

To run a Jupyter notebook and explore the analysis interactively, navigate to the notebook's directory and run:

jupyter notebook
